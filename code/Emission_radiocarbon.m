function [ETable] = Emission_radiocarbon()
%% TODO: 
% Before implementing this function, we first need to fix the file format
% of empirical distributions of radiocarbon data, and check whether the
% depth indexes of del-O18 data and those of radiocarbon data are matched.


%% This function generates emission distributions for each radiocarbon data given parameters.
% It is expected to see some depth indexes in which any radiocarbon
% distribution is given: assign 1 (if we take logarithmic values, 0) with
% the entries of ETable corresponding to them.
